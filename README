xcalibrator
===========

xcalibrator is a simple frontend shell script, which uses the argyll tools 
to calibrate and profile your display using a colorimeter.

this project should be construed as a fully fledged project in it's own 
right but rather as an example on how to write similar scripts for your 
own personal use.

dependancies
============
